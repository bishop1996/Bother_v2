# Desktop Kit by Dropbox

Over 100 macOS UI components ranging from buttons and push notifications to fully working applications.
This kit gives you the building blocks to design incredible desktop experiences.

## Introducing LiveKit

A set of pre-built interactive components for use throughout your prototypes to mimic a desktop environment.

### Finder

Use placeholder content or pull in live data from your Dropbox account. You can navigate within folders and even change the size of the content grid. Toggle between showing icons or thumbnails for images, videos and PDF files.

All folder and file icons are provided as Design Components to make it easy to create your own layouts.

### Browser

Choose between Safari or Chrome to render any design. Enable "Live Site" mode to render a real website for a given URL. Currently, cross-domain URLs (like Google.com) aren't supported.

### LiveDesktop (Experimental)

Connect frames to the LiveDesktop Component and see them come to life as app windows that can be rearranged, resized and opened/closed.

Name your connected frames as common macOS apps (Finder, Chrome, Messages, etc.) and see their icons show up in the Dock. Use your own app icon by including a hidden frame labeled "App Icon" inside your connected frames.

The LiveDesktop Component also includes different wallpaper and background color options. Try setting "Canvas â€” Responsive" while in Preview for best results.

## Design Components

Dozens of design components for app icons, buttons, alerts, push notifications, the macOS Dock and Menu Bar, and even an example Messages application.
